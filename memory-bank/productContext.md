# BrainRoad Labs Website - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

The BrainRoad Labs website serves as a professional showcase for the BrainRoad Labs company, highlighting its skills, projects, and services. It demonstrates the company's technical expertise through an innovative and interactive user experience.

## How It Should Work

The site uses a custom scrolling mechanism that creates a unique navigation experience:

3. **Adaptability**: The interface automatically adapts to screen orientation (portrait/landscape).

5. **Splash Screen**: A splash screen welcomes visitors with an entry animation.
