# BrainRoad Labs Website - Progress

## What Works

### Core Structure
- âœ… Basic project setup with Astro and Tailwind CSS
- âœ… Component-based architecture implemented
- âœ… Main layout structure with content wrapper

### Components
- âœ… Home component with basic content
- âœ… Project component structure
- âœ… Contact component structure
- âœ… Explanation component structure
- âœ… Credits component structure

### Visual Elements
- âœ… Gradient background with animated bubbles
- âœ… Splash screen with basic animation
- âœ… Custom badge styling
- âœ… Typography with Geist and Geist Mono fonts
- âœ… Responsive layout adjustments based on orientation

### Functionality

- âœ… Navigation menu with section links
- âœ… Manual navigation controls (increment/decrement buttons)
- âœ… Touch event handling for mobile devices

## What's Left to Build

### High Priority
- ðŸ”„ Implement scrollTransitionV2.js with improved scroll transition logic
- ðŸ”„ CSS for vertical mode transitions
- ðŸ”„ Menu hover effects and active section highlighting
- ðŸ”„ Improved touch and wheel event coordination

### Medium Priority
- ðŸ”„ Complete logo design and splash screen implementation
- ðŸ”„ Clean up Layout.astro file
- ðŸ”„ Add SEO meta tags
- ðŸ”„ Create and implement favicon

### Low Priority
- ðŸ”„ Cross-browser testing
- ðŸ”„ Mobile device testing
- ðŸ”„ Performance optimization
- ðŸ”„ Additional content for Project section

## Current Status

The website is in active development with the basic structure and components in place. The custom scroll transition mechanism is partially implemented but needs refinement. The site is functional but several enhancements are needed to improve the user experience and complete the implementation.

### Development Milestones
1. âœ… **Initial Setup**: Project structure and dependencies
2. âœ… **Component Creation**: Basic components for all sections
3. âœ… **Visual Design**: Basic styling and animations
4. ðŸ”„ **Interaction Development**: Custom scroll and navigation (in progress)
5. ðŸ“… **Refinement**: Polishing UI and UX
6. ðŸ“… **Testing**: Cross-browser and device testing
7. ðŸ“… **Launch Preparation**: Final optimizations and checks

## Known Issues

1. scrollTransitionV2.js is currently empty and not functional
2. Navigation menu doesn't highlight the active section
3. CSS for vertical mode transitions needs improvement
4. Several TODO items in the codebase need to be addressed
5. Temporary development controls need to be removed from the final version

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach
- Started with a standard scrolling website
- Decided to implement custom scroll behavior for a more unique experience
- Chose Astro for its balance of static generation and dynamic capabilities

### Current Direction
- Focusing on refining the custom scroll transition mechanism
- Improving the responsive design for different screen orientations
- Enhancing the visual design with gradient animations and smooth transitions

### Future Considerations
- May need to balance the unique scroll experience with more conventional navigation for better usability
- Consider adding more interactive elements to showcase technical capabilities
- Potential for adding a blog or more detailed project showcase section
