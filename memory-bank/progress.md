# BrainRoad Labs Website - Progress

## Tasks In Progress / To Do

### Content Sections (Partially Implemented / Placeholders)
- ðŸš§ **Contact**: Structure present, content is placeholder ("XXX").
- ðŸš§ **Unlck-u**: New section, structure present, content is placeholder ("XXX").
- ðŸš§ **Projects**: Review/Correct content. Ensure project descriptions are accurate and not duplicated. Add dates as per TODO.

### High Priority / Core Functionality
- ðŸ”„ **Refine `navigation.js`**: The core navigation logic is now in `navigation.js`. The focus is on improving gesture detection (wheel, touch) for a smoother user experience.
- ðŸ”„ **CSS for Vertical Mode Transitions**: Ensure transitions and layouts are optimal in portrait/vertical orientations (mentioned as a TODO in `activeContext.md` previously, still relevant).

### Content & UI Completion
- ðŸ”„ **Fill Placeholder Content**: Populate `Contact.astro`, `Unlck-u.astro` with actual content.
- ðŸ”„ **Complete Logo & Splash Screen**: Integrate final logo. The splash screen has been updated to a Lottie animation.
- ðŸ”„ **Navigation Menu**:
    - Address potential `data-nav-id` issue for `Credits` and `Unlck-u` sections (both point to the same).
    - Ensure hover effects and active section highlighting are robust.

### General Polish & Optimization
- ðŸ”„ **SEO Optimization**: Add meta tags.
- ðŸ”„ **Cross-browser & Mobile Testing**: Thoroughly test on various browsers and devices (TODOs exist).
- ðŸ”„ **Address All TODOs**: Systematically review and address TODO comments throughout the codebase.
- ðŸ”„ **Ability to Disable a Page**: A new feature to consider.

## Current Status
The website is in an active development phase. The core navigation system is centralized in `src/scripts/navigation.js`. The main priorities are to enhance this system, populate placeholder content, and polish the UI.

## Known Issues / Key TODOs from Code
- Navigation logic is now in `navigation.js`; further refinement is needed.
- Placeholder content remains in `Contact`, `Unlck-u`, and `Project`.
- The `data-nav-id` for `Credits` and `Unlck-u` needs correction.
- Various `TODO` comments for cleanup and new features need to be addressed.
