                Engineered CheckAI, a proof-of-concept <strong>change detection tool</strong> using the “The Change You Want to See” co-attention model (WACV 2023) to automate <strong>before/after image comparison for short-term rentals</strong>. I integrated the full inference pipeline via Flask and served a responsive UI with bounding-box overlays.<br />
                To meet hardware constraints, I adapted the training and inference flow to run <strong>entirely on CPU</strong> — including Apple Silicon — by bypassing CUDA dependencies, optimizing model loading, and tweaking detection thresholds and visualizations.<br />

            <h3 class="text-gray-400!">June-September 2024 (4-month build)</h3>
            <p>
                <h3>Summary.</h3>
                Built the end-to-end <strong>GenAI experience for JPG's ecommerce site</strong>: users pick a Parisian phrase (available in 7 languages), record a short mouth clip, and the system isolates, beautifies, and composites the lips onto AI-generated skies, publishing brand-safe videos to a live <strong>“wall of mouths”</strong>.<br />At each key step, Xano orchestrated the flow and sent transactional emails via SendGrid to keep users informed.<br />
                <h3 class="mt-2">Role & scope</h3>
                • Lead engineer: front-end JavaScript, back-end, <strong>GenAI/ML pipeline (ComfyUI)</strong>, DevOps, and moderation tooling.<br />
                • Team: UX/UI designer + one front collaborator; I owned the pipeline, infra, and all of the app logic.<br />
                <h3 class="mt-2">Stack</h3>
                • GenAI / ML: ComfyUI with custom SDXL model, custom LoRA(s) for lipstick styling (trained on synthetic dataset, <a href="https://civitai.com/user/TomySpagnoletti" target="_blank">released on CivitAI</a>), AnimateDiff for <strong>frame-to-frame consistency</strong>, SAM + Grounding DINO for segmentation/detection, ControlNet, CLIP (pos/neg), KSampler, FILM VFI for interpolation, VAE, video combine...<br />
                • Infra: <strong>AWS</strong> EC2 (ComfyUI in Docker), S3 for input/output storage.<br />
                • Backend: Xano (job orchestration, APIs, DB in <strong>Postgres</strong>, callback handling, SendGrid integration).<br />
                • Front: vanilla JavaScript experience embedded in JPG's site; mobile & desktop camera capture.<br />
                • Content: backgrounds via Midjourney, JPG's voiceover via ElevenLabs.<br />
                • Admin: <strong>custom Vue.js back-office</strong> for moderation and wall management.<br />
                <h3 class="mt-2">ComfyUI Workflow</h3>
                <strong>1.</strong> Fetch video from S3 → drop 1 frame out of 2 to reduce RAM, since one user video produced 3 outputs (HD+FHD landscape for the site, and FHD portrait for social).<br />
                <strong>2.</strong> Generate new video via KSampler with prompts (pos/neg), ControlNets, the source video, and AnimateDiff to enforce temporal consistency.<br />
                <strong>3.</strong> Mask/detour the new video.<br />
                <strong>4.</strong> In parallel, generate a second “lipstick-only” red-lips video, used as a guiding mask to help SAM + Grounding DINO perform more accurate segmentation.<br />
                <strong>5.</strong> Apply this mask to the main custom video.<br />
                <strong>6.</strong> Upscale useful frames from 1024x576 to HD and FHD variants.<br />
                <strong>7.</strong> Composite lips onto AI skies.<br />
                <strong>8.</strong> FILM VFI interpolation → 60 fps for smoothness.<br />
                <strong>9.</strong> Mix original audio back into the final render.<br />
                <strong>10.</strong> Push 3 new videos (HD, FHD, social) to S3 + Postgres/Xano, triggering callbacks and user notifications via SendGrid.<br />
                <h3 class="mt-2">Engineering highlights</h3>
                • Designed a <strong>multi-branch ComfyUI pipeline</strong> combining AnimateDiff, ControlNets, segmentation feedback loops (red-lips masking) and more.<br />
                • Balanced RAM + GPU limits by <strong>frame-sampling + smart upscale</strong>, while still hitting <strong>high-res deliverables</strong> (example below).<br />
                • Automated 7-language UX with transactional emails for transparency (recorded → processing → published).<br />
                • Built a moderation back-office (Vue.js) with review queues, “On the Wall” toggles, and safe-publish controls.<br />
                • <strong>Containerized inference on EC2</strong> for reproducibility and scale.<br />
                <h3 class="mt-2">Result</h3>
                A visually striking, multilingual UGC experience that transforms <strong>noisy webcam clips into branded AI videos</strong>, manages moderation, and delights users with live publication on the “wall of mouths”.

            <h3 class="text-gray-400!">April '20 – September '23</h3>
            <p>
                Built and led a <strong>Web3 social network</strong> with a team of front-end and back-end developers, UI/UX designers, and a marketing squad. The project aimed to give content ownership back to users through <strong>NFT-based posts</strong> and a <strong>native cryptocurrency (XKO)</strong>.<br />
                • <strong>Decentralized Ownership</strong>: Users could mint <strong>photo and video NFTs</strong> directly from their devices and manage them via a <strong>non-custodial in-app wallet</strong>.<br />
                • <strong>Seamless UX + Security</strong>: Implemented <strong>ERC-20 meta-transactions on Polygon and Ethereum</strong>, enabling gasless transactions with transparent signature handling.<br />
                • <strong>Native Token Economy</strong>: Designed <strong>Like+Ko</strong> (tip-based likes with customizable XKO amounts) and <strong>Pay-to-View</strong> content monetization.<br />
                • <strong>Crypto Features</strong>: Enabled peer-to-peer XKO transfers and NFT minting with frictionless mobile experience.<br />
                • <strong>Recognition</strong>: Invited to <strong>CES 2023</strong> with a <a href="https://www.ces.tech/articles/2023/february/ces-2023-spotlights-tech-for-good/#:~:text=Regarding%20Web3%2C%20the,special%20skills%20required." target="_blank">"Spotlight Tech for Good" mention</a>, leading to high-level discussions with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jholcombe/" target="_blank">Jamie Holcombe (USPTO CIO)</a>.<br />
                • <strong>Social App Experience</strong>: Positioned as a blend of <strong>TikTok + Instagram</strong>, with support for text, audio, photo, and video posts — NFTs reserved for photo/video content.<br />
                Despite full feature completion and completion of many versions, <strong>Apple Store in-app monetization restrictions</strong> and fundraising challenges in France led to the project pivoting into <strong>Shaaare</strong> (above).
